# Breast Cancer Incidence Forecasting in India – JAIR Research Project

This repository accompanies the research paper titled:

**"Machine Learning–Based Forecasting of Breast Cancer Incidence in India Using Population-Based Registries"** (Submitted to *JAIR* – Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research).

## 📊 Overview

We developed a machine learning framework to forecast Age Adjusted Incidence Rates (AAR) of breast cancer across 28 Indian PBCR regions using:
- Demographic features (female literacy, urban %)
- Behavioral indicators (screening %, obesity %, tobacco/alcohol use)
- Health infrastructure data (beds per 1000)
- Historical AARs (2012–2016, extrapolated to 2024)

Models Trained:
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- Ridge Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Multivariate LSTM
